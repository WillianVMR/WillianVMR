### Hi there 👋

#### 🚴‍♂️🏊‍♂️🏃‍♂️ Triathlete at Heart, Data Scientist by Profession

Hello! I'm Willian, you can call me Will, a passionate triathlete and an aspiring data scientist currently delving into the world of data engineering. My journey in sports has taught me the values of resilience, discipline, and continuous improvement, traits that I bring into my professional life as well.

As a data scientist, I'm intrigued by the power of data and how it can be used to solve complex problems. I'm currently expanding my expertise into data engineering, aiming to bridge the gap between raw data and meaningful insights.

What excites me the most is the beauty of mathematics. I'm fascinated by mathematical problems and their applications in the real world. My approach is unique: I love transforming theoretical problems into mathematical models, and then bringing these models to life through coding. This method allows me to not only solve problems but also to create efficient, scalable solutions.

I'm always eager to connect with fellow professionals and enthusiasts in the fields of data science, mathematics, and athletics. Let's share ideas, challenges, and insights!
